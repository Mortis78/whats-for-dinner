# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. You will be building an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. 

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <>  i Gained experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
 i had to write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> 
One really big one for me is understanding the structure for HTML. 
I used excalodraw to design the main page and then labeled each section as I included it which made it really easy to follow the correct layout when designing my HTML.
Another really big win is development of my understanding of CSS, beginning of the week it felt very shaky and it didn't get better until I really started spending some time with it excited that I've come as far as I have
